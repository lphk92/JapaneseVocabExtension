JapaneseVocabExtension
======================

This is an extension for Google Chrome which will quiz users on a Japanese vocabulary word everytime they open or close a tab.

Users are able to create their own lists to quiz from on the options page, or import a list from an Comma Sepearated Values (CSV) file.

#Known Bugs
- Nonexistent empty entry (see 日本語4第3か漢字)

#Things to do
- Allow editing of existing entries
- Added functionality for search for a specific entry in a list (easier to delete entries)
- Add functionality for disabling words on a list without deleting them
- Create a "Quiztime Mode" (just a standard quiz for when you have the time)
- Create a "Kanji Mode"
- Add a dictionary so that users don't have to input all of their own definitions (long-term goal)
- Add the ability to download your existing lists as CSV files (reverse conversion)
