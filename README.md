JapaneseVocabExtension
======================

This is an extension for Google Chrome which will quiz the user on a Japanese vocabulary word everytime they open or close a tab.

Users are able to create their own lists to quiz from on the options page, or import a list from an Comma Sepearated Values (CSV) file.
