        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
        This extension aims to help individuals studying Japanese to expand their vocabulary, without setting aside the extra time to dedicate specifically to studying. Every time a user opens or closes a tab, this extension will quiz them on a vocab word from a list you've created! That way, you can work to expand your vocabulary as you browse the web, with very little extra effort. Users can manage as many lists as you like, and upload a vocabulary list from an existing Comma-Separated-Values (CSV) file.
        </p>
